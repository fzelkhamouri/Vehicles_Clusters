# Vehicles_Clusters

### An automobile manufacturer has developed prototypes for a new vehicle. Before introducing the new model into its range, the manufacturer wants to determine which existing vehicles on the market are most like the prototypes--that is, how vehicles can be grouped, which group is the most similar with the model, and therefore which models they will be competing against.

### The objective, is to use clustering methods, to find the most distinctive clusters of vehicles. It will summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacturers to make decision about the supply of new models.

# Result
### We have 3 main clusters with the majority of vehicles in those.

### Cars:

### Cluster 1: with almost high mpg, and low in horsepower.
### Cluster 2: with good mpg and horsepower, but higher price than average.
### Cluster 3: with low mpg, high horsepower, highest price.

### Trucks:

### Cluster 1: with almost highest mpg among trucks, and lowest in horsepower and price.
### Cluster 2: with almost low mpg and medium horsepower, but higher price than average.
### Cluster 3: with good mpg and horsepower, low price.

### Notice that we did not use type , and price of cars in the clustering process, but Hierarchical clustering could forge the clusters and discriminate them with quite high accuracy.
